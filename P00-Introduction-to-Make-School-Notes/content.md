Welcome to the *Make School Notes* tutorial series and congratulations on taking the first step to building your very own iOS app! We're going to build something very similar to iOS's built in Notes app - an easy way for you to jot down some notes.

This series was designed for beginning iOS developers and will teach you the fundamentals of iOS application development. After finishing this series, you will have built a fully functional note taking app and will be well prepared to start the more advanced tutorial, *Makestagram*.

The final product will look something like this:

The *Make School Notes* tutorial consists of three parts:

1. In the first part we will focus on building the **interface** of our app. You will learn how to:
	* Display lists of information using table views
	* Create custom table view cells in Interface Builder
	* Create new view controllers
	* Setup navigation controllers
	* Use segues to transition between view controllers
	* Trigger user initiated actions using bar button items

2. The second part is devoted to programming our app's **logic**. You will learn how to:
	* Create appropriate data models
	* Pass data between view controllers
	* Program the functionality to add, display, modify, and delete notes
	* Connect app interface to app logic

3. In the third and final part we will focus on **persisting data** between app launches. You will learn how to:
	* Locally store information using the CoreData framework
	* Create static helper methods
	* Modify existing code to integrate data persistence

*Persisting data* is a fancy way of saying "saving data to disk". Apps in iOS don't keep data around between app launches by default, it's up to you as the developer to implement it.

#Getting Started

The goal of this tutorial is to teach you the fundamentals of iOS development, not to confuse you with how to set up Xcode projects. For this reason, we have provided a starter project that will allow you to hit the ground running with learning iOS development.
